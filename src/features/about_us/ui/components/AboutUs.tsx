              Pharus Creative was born with a clear vision: to be a lighthouse for ideas, stories, and moments that deserve to be told with art.
            </p>
            <p className="about-text font-body">
              We are a creative studio based in Montreal, specializing in photography, video production, content creation, and digital marketing. We offer a complete experience where every visual detail is crafted with intention and soul, from intimate weddings to brand campaigns.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p className="about-text font-body">
              Our focus is to guide, support, and help you see your story from a new perspective. It's not just about capturing images — it's about illuminating emotion, building identity, and leaving a mark.
            </p>
            <p className="about-text font-body">
              Our inspiration comes from a personal journey: a first camera, the encouragement of friends, the support of family, and a passion that grew into something real. Pharus Creative is more than just one person — it's a shared light, a team that believes in the beauty of authenticity and the power of thoughtful visuals.
            </p>

            <p className="about-text font-body">
              We are based in Montreal, but we connect with people and ideas anywhere. Because here at Pharus Creative, love stories, brands, and moments are illuminated with art.
